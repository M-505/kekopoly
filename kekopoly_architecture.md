### State Management Approach

#### Layered State Architecture

The system uses a layered approach to state management:

1. **Frontend State Layer**:
   - Redux Toolkit for client-side state management
   - Organized into slices for different game aspects (board, properties, players, cards)
   - Optimistic UI updates for responsive user experience
   - Local states for UI-specific components

2. **Synchronization Layer**:
   - Socket.io for real-time updates between clients and server
   - Event-based communication for game actions
   - Broadcast, direct, and room-based messaging patterns

3. **Persistence Layer**:
   - Redis for fast, in-memory active game states
   - MongoDB for durable storage and historical data
   - Transaction journal for audit and recovery

4. **Blockchain Layer**:
   - Read-only state synchronization for token balances
   - Transaction preparation and signing
   - Settlement verification

#### State Synchronization Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Full state loaded from MongoDB at game start
   - Active state maintained in Redis
   - Frontend receives complete initial state

2. **Regular Updates**:
   - Delta updates sent via WebSockets for efficiency
   - Periodic full state synchronization to prevent drift
   - Critical actions verified server-side before state changes

3. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Server is the source of truth for game state
   - Client predictions with server validation
   - Version vector for state reconciliation

4. **Persistence Strategy**:
   - Write-ahead logging for critical operations
   - Snapshots at significant game milestones
   - Transaction journal for complete history

## Blockchain Integration

### Solana Wallet Integration Architecture

The Kekopoly game integrates with Solana blockchain wallets to enable secure token operations for game entry and winnings settlement.

#### Wallet Connection Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant SolanaWallet
    participant Blockchain
    
    User->>Frontend: Click "Connect Wallet"
    Frontend->>SolanaWallet: Request connection
    SolanaWallet-->>User: Request permission
    User->>SolanaWallet: Approve connection
    SolanaWallet-->>Frontend: Return wallet address
    Frontend->>Backend: Register wallet address
    
    Backend->>Frontend: Request signature challenge
    Frontend->>SolanaWallet: Request signature
    SolanaWallet-->>User: Show message to sign
    User->>SolanaWallet: Confirm signature
    SolanaWallet-->>Frontend: Return signed message
    Frontend->>Backend: Submit signature
    
    Backend->>Backend: Verify signature against address
    Backend->>Blockchain: Check token balance
    Blockchain-->>Backend: Return balance information
    Backend-->>Frontend: Wallet verified & balance confirmed
    Frontend-->>User: Wallet successfully connected
```

#### Wallet Verification Process

1. **Connection Phase**:
   - Frontend uses Solana Wallet Adapter to detect available wallet extensions
   - User selects their preferred wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
   - Wallet adapter establishes connection and provides public key

2. **Authentication Phase**:
   - Backend generates a unique challenge message with timestamp and nonce
   - Frontend requests user to sign this message with their wallet
   - Signature and original message are sent to backend
   - Backend verifies the signature matches the wallet address
   - Upon verification, a JWT token is issued to authorize subsequent requests

3. **Verification Lifecycle**:
   - Authentication valid for one gaming session
   - Periodic re-verification during long sessions
   - Signature checks before critical operations
   - Session invalidation on suspicious activity

4. **Security Measures**:
   - Time-limited challenge messages
   - Prevention of challenge reuse
   - Rate limiting on verification attempts
   - Multi-factor authentication for high-value games

### Token Deposit and Settlement Mechanism

The token economy operates on Solana blockchain using Kekels Meme Tokens (KMT).

#### Initial Deposit Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Player
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant SolanaWallet
    participant Blockchain

    Frontend-->>Player: Show deposit requirement
    Player->>Frontend: Confirm deposit
    
    Frontend->>Backend: Generate deposit instruction
    Backend->>Backend: Create deposit address
    Backend-->>Frontend: Return deposit instructions
    
    Frontend->>SolanaWallet: Request token transfer
    SolanaWallet-->>Player: Confirm transaction
    Player->>SolanaWallet: Approve transaction
    SolanaWallet->>Blockchain: Submit transaction
    Blockchain-->>SolanaWallet: Transaction confirmed
    
    SolanaWallet-->>Frontend: Transaction signature
    Frontend->>Backend: Verify deposit
    Backend->>Blockchain: Check transaction status
    Blockchain-->>Backend: Confirm deposit received
    
    Backend->>Backend: Credit player's in-game balance
    Backend-->>Frontend: Deposit confirmed
    Frontend-->>Player: Ready to play
```

#### Game Settlement Flow

    Note over Backend: Game ends, winner determined
    Backend->>Backend: Calculate winner's payout
    Backend->>Winner: Request settlement approval
    Winner->>Backend: Confirm settlement
    
    Backend->>Backend: Prepare settlement transaction
    Backend->>Blockchain: Submit settlement transaction
    Blockchain-->>Backend: Transaction pending
    
    loop Until confirmation
        Backend->>Blockchain: Check transaction status
        Blockchain-->>Backend: Return status
    end
    
    Blockchain-->>Backend: Transaction confirmed
    Backend->>Backend: Update settlement records
    Backend-->>Winner: Settlement complete notification

## Disconnection Handling

The Kekopoly game implements a robust disconnection handling system to ensure game continuity while providing reasonable opportunity for players to reconnect.

### Disconnection Detection and Management Process

1. **Detection Phase**:
   - WebSocket heartbeat mechanism detects broken connections
   - Client-side reconnection attempts automatically on disconnect
   - User-initiated reconnects supported through reconnection API

2. **Grace Period Phase**:
   - When disconnection detected, player marked as DISCONNECTED
   - 3-minute countdown timer initiated
   - Periodic ping attempts to disconnected client
   - Other players notified of disconnection with countdown
   - Game paused if disconnection occurs during player's turn

3. **Reconnection Phase**:
   - If player reconnects within 3 minutes:
     - Player status restored to ACTIVE
     - Full game state sent to reconnected player
     - Game resumed from previous state
     - Other players notified of successful reconnection

4. **Forfeiture Phase**:
   - If player fails to reconnect within 3 minutes:
     - Player status changed to FORFEITED
     - Player's assets managed according to forfeiture rules
     - Game continues with remaining players
     - Forfeited player cannot rejoin this game instance

### Asset Handling Upon Forfeiture

1. **Property Disposition**:
   - Unmortgaged properties revert to unowned status (available for purchase)
   - Mortgaged properties stay mortgaged but become available for purchase at mortgage value
   - Houses and hotels (Engagements and Blue Checkmarks) remain on properties

2. **Token Distribution**:
   - Forfeited player's Kekels remain in the game economy
   - If player was winning, their potential winnings are redistributed to remaining players
   - Initial deposit is forfeit and added to the final winner's payout

3. **Special Handling**:
   - Get Out of Jail (Verification) cards return to respective decks
   - Active special effects applied by the player remain in effect until expiration
   - Pending trades are automatically cancelled

### Recovery Mechanisms

1. **Session Management**:
   - Unique session tokens identify specific game connections
   - Sessions persist across temporary disconnections
   - Players can authenticate and recover their previous game state

2. **State Recovery**:
   - Full game state snapshot provided on reconnection
   - Catch-up mechanism for missed events
   - Transaction log replay if needed for consistency

3. **Dispute Resolution**:
   - Admin tools for manual intervention in edge cases
   - Game state history available for review
   - Blockchain record of deposits for verification

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization

1. **User Authentication**:
   - JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
   - Password-less wallet-based authentication
   - Rate limiting on authentication attempts
   - Session management with appropriate timeouts

2. **Wallet Security**:
   - Challenge-response signature verification
   - No private keys stored server-side
   - Wallet-signed transactions only
   - Regular re-authentication for sensitive operations

3. **API Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control
   - Scoped API tokens
   - Operation-level permissions
   - IP-based restrictions for admin functions

### Game Integrity

1. **Anti-Cheat Measures**:
   - Server-side validation of all game actions
   - Cryptographically secure random number generation
   - Server-authoritative game state
   - Action replay protection
   - Rate limiting on game actions

2. **Game State Protection**:
   - Transaction logs for state changes
   - Database-level constraints and validations
   - Immutable event history
   - Periodic state consistency checks

3. **Economic Safeguards**:
   - Maximum bet/wager limits
   - Automated unusual activity detection
   - Circuit breakers for extreme market conditions
   - Admin alerts for suspicious patterns

### Infrastructure Security

1. **Network Security**:
   - TLS for all connections
   - API Gateway with WAF protection
   - DDoS mitigation
   - Network segmentation
   - Regular security scans

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encryption at rest for sensitive data
   - Secure key management
   - Regular backups with encryption
   - Data retention policies

3. **Operational Security**:
   - Least privilege access model
   - Audit logging of admin actions
   - Automated security testing in CI/CD
   - Regular penetration testing

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling

1. **Game Server Scaling**:
   - Game instances distributed across multiple servers
   - Game sharding by region or load
   - Stateless API servers with auto-scaling
   - Load balancer distribution

2. **Database Scaling**:
   - MongoDB sharding for game data
   - Read replicas for high-read operations
   - Redis cluster for distributed caching
   - Database connection pooling

3. **WebSocket Scaling**:
   - Socket.io with Redis adapter for cross-server messaging
   - Socket connection distribution with sticky sessions
   - Separate WebSocket servers from API servers
   - Gradual scaling based on connection count

### Performance Optimization

1. **Data Access Patterns**:
   - Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
   - Denormalized data models for game state
   - Indexing strategy for common queries
   - Batch operations for multiple updates

2. **Network Optimization**:
   - CDN for static assets
   - WebSocket message compression
   - Partial updates rather than full state transfers
   - Binary protocols for efficient data transfer

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Connection pooling for database and services
   - Graceful degradation under high load
   - Resource quotas per game/player
   - Background processing for non-critical operations

### Monitoring & Capacity Planning

1. **Key Metrics**:
   - Active games and players
   - WebSocket connections and message rate
   - Database operation latency
   - API response times
   - Blockchain transaction success rate

2. **Auto-scaling Triggers**:
   - Connection count thresholds
   - CPU/Memory utilization
   - Queue depth
   - Error rate

3. **Capacity Planning**:
   - Historical usage analysis
   - Predictive scaling for peak times
