# Kekopoly: Modified Game Rules

## Game Overview
Kekopoly is a multiplayer property trading board game based on internet meme culture, using Kekels Meme Tokens (KMT) on the Solana blockchain. This modified version introduces unique mechanics that enhance the meme theme and create a more dynamic gameplay experience.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT TOKEN VALUE NOTICE** ⚠️  
*This game uses real Kekels Meme Tokens (KMT) on the Solana blockchain. Game outcomes can affect token value. Participate at your own risk and only play with tokens you can afford to lose.*

## Key Rule Modifications

### Starting Money & Economy
- Players start with **2000 Kekels** 
- The "KEKOPOLY COLLECT 200 KEKELS" space now awards 200 Kekels, but also requires the player to post a meme in the game chat (verified by other players)
- When a player passes START, they can choose to collect either 100 Kekels OR draw a card from any deck

### Property & Rent Changes
- **Rent Multipliers**: Properties in the same color group have a 3x multiplier (instead of 2x) when owned by the same player
- **Meme Stations**: Now called "Engagement" and represent viral popularity
- **Viral Centers**: Now called "Blue Checkmarks" and represent verified status
- **Ownership Display**: Properties now show the owner's meme character as a visual indicator

### Special Space Rules
- **Gaming Chair**: When landing on this space, the player can choose to "Stream" a property they own, doubling its rent for the next 3 rounds
- **FREE SPACE**: When landing on any Free Space, players can choose to "Touch Grass" (skip their next turn) to collect 150 Kekels
- **RAGE TRAIN** and **PEPE TRAIN**: Transit properties now have special movement abilities - the owner can choose to move to another transit property once per round
- **KEK SERVERS**: When owning this utility, player can "host" one property, making it immune to negative card effects

### New Jail Mechanics
- **Meme Jail**: Renamed to "Shadowban"
- To get out of Shadowban, a player can:
  - Pay 50 Kekels
  - Roll doubles
  - Use a "Verification" card
  - Sacrifice one Engagement/Blue Checkmark from any owned property
- While shadowbanned, a player can still collect rent but at half the normal rate

### Card System Overhaul
- Cards now have three rarity tiers: Common (green), Rare (blue), and Legendary (gold)
- Players hold cards in their "hand" and can play them strategically (limit 3 cards held at once)
- New "Combo" mechanics - playing specific card combinations creates powerful effects

## Special Meme Rules

### Kek's Blessing
If a player owns all Temple of Kek properties, they can invoke "Kek's Blessing" once per game to avoid paying rent when landing on another player's property.

### Giga Chad Move
Once per game, each player can make a "Giga Chad Move" when landing on another player's property. This allows them to challenge the owner to a dice roll - if the challenger rolls higher, they don't pay rent; if the owner rolls higher, the challenger pays double rent.

### The Redpill
When passing START, a player can choose to be "redpilled" - they skip collecting 100 Kekels but get to draw a Redpill Card for a possible greater reward (or punishment).

### Meme Economy Crash
At the start of each round, the first player rolls one die. If a 6 is rolled, the meme economy crashes - all players must forfeit 10% of their cash 

### New Rule: Dankest Meme
Once per game, a player can declare "Dankest Meme" when they own at least 3 properties. All other players vote on whether to approve. If approved, the player collects 50 Kekels from each player. If rejected, the player pays 50 Kekels to each player.

### New Rule: Meme Royalties
When a player builds the first Engagement on a property, they name the "meme" for that property. Every time any player lands on that property, they must say the meme name or pay an additional 10 Kekels.

### New Rule: Blockchain Fork
If a player lands on START and rolls doubles on their next turn, they can initiate a "Blockchain Fork" - all property values are reassessed and either increase or decrease by 25% (determined by a die roll: 1-3 decrease, 4-6 increase).

## Building Mechanics

### Engagement (Houses)
- First Engagement: Base rent × 5
- Second Engagement: Base rent × 15
- Third Engagement: Base rent × 30
- Fourth Engagement: Base rent × 45

### Blue Checkmark (Hotel)
- Blue Checkmark: Base rent × 70

### Viral Trend Mechanic
When a player builds a Blue Checkmark, they start a "Viral Trend" - all other players must pay 10 Kekels to the next player when passing (not landing on) that property for the next full round.
